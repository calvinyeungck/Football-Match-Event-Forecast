The code and dataset for the proposed model are contained in the following files.

1.dataset_create.py creates the csv dataset from the json file retrived from the [WyScout Open Access Dataset](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/14464685/events.zip) and the corresponding heatmaps for the grouped actions (pass, dribble, cross, shot, and possession end).

2.train_valid_test_split.py creates the other continouses features and split the csv dataset created in step 1 into to train/valid/test according to the 0.8/0.1/0.1 ratio.
